## Overview
[atopile](https://atopile.io/) is a tool to build electronic circuit boards with code. It brings the best of software development to the world of hardware design.

The atopile [package registry](https://packages.atopile.io/) contains a list of existing ato packages. Packages usually contain components, module footprints, and layouts that can be reused in other projects.

A package usually points to a git repository (such as this one) that contains the design files, in a similar fashion to a standard atopile project.

The ESP32-S3 is a powerful, versatile microcontroller designed for IoT applications. It features dual-core Xtensa LX7 processors, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 connectivity, rich I/O capabilities, and enhanced security features, making it ideal for smart home devices, wearable electronics, and automated systems requiring efficient processing and wireless communication.
